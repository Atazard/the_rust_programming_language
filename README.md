# the_rust_programming_language
My journey through the book The Rust programming language.

Most chapters of the book have different excersices to ease you into Rust.
This repo contains every project created to test stuff for each chapter of the book.

- Create a new project with cargo:  
cargo new project_name

- Update settings.json so rust-analyzer can work properly:  
add ".\\project_name\\Cargo.toml" 

- Go to the new project folder (tab can autocomplete the name):  
cd project_name

- Run the project (you should see the default Hello, world!):  
cargo run
